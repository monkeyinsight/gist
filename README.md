create `.env` file in root folder with contents:

`GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=[put your token here]`<br/>
`PORT=3000`

and you can deploy `docker` container to aws, there are plenty of guides how to do that (like this one https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/create-container-image.html )<br/>
I didn't setup `nginx` in front of app but there was no requirement
